Just letting you know that by COB today, all the cloudy simulations for the 6 days (2006- 8/3, 8/15, 9/15, 12/15, 3/15, 6/15) will be complete.  
 
The level1 (output from the CRTM) files are in the directory:
 
/discover/nobackup/projects/hympi/rirosenb/crtm/all_sky/output/G5NR_grid_ocean_day/level1
 
In this directory, there are subdirectories named <yyyymmddhhmn> for each date/time, and in each of those, there are subdirectories named <yyyymmddhhmn_sss> for each 2-degree strip. 
Each <yyyymmddhhmn_sss> subdirectory either contains the expected set of level 1 files or, if there was not data, it is empty.  
 
The corresponding level2 (72-level and 100-level)  files are in the directory:
 
/discover/nobackup/projects/hympi/rirosenb/crtm/all_sky/output/G5NR_grid_ocean_day/level2
 
In this directory, like before, there are 2 subdirectories: v27 (for 100-level) and v41 (for 72-level).  In each of those subdirectories, there are subdirectories named <yyyymmddhhmn> for each date/time, and in each of those, there is the usual set of 180 files, one for each 2-degree strip.    Like before, if there is no data for a particular strip, then the file is empty.
