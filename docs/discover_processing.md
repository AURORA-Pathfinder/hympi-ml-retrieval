## Processing the CosMIR-H on Discover
To get the training data we use, we'll need to process CRTM data from discover.

To do that, simply logon to discover and navitage to `/discover/nobackup/projects/hympi/dgershm1/`.

From there you'll see a few python files and scripts, to learn how to use them, read the `README.txt` for more details.
